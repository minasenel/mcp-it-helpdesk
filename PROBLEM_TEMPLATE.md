# IT Help Desk - Problem Report Template

## üìã How to Report a Technical Issue

When reporting a problem to the IT Help Desk Agent, please provide the following information:

### üîç **Problem Description**
Describe what is happening in detail:
- What exactly is not working?
- When did the problem start?
- What were you trying to do when it happened?

### üè∑Ô∏è **Category** (Choose the most relevant)
- **Hardware**: Computer, laptop, printer, mouse, keyboard, monitor issues
- **Software**: Applications, programs, system software issues
- **Network**: Internet, WiFi, VPN, email connectivity issues
- **Access**: Login, password, account, permissions issues

### ‚ö° **Priority Level**
- **High**: Critical system down, can't work, urgent business impact
- **Medium**: Important but workaround available, affects productivity
- **Low**: Minor issue, can work around it, not urgent

## üìù **Example Problem Reports**

### ‚úÖ **Good Examples:**

**VPN Issue:**
```
My VPN connection keeps dropping every 10-15 minutes. I'm working from home and need stable access to company servers. This started happening yesterday after the system update. I'm using Cisco AnyConnect on Windows 11.
```

**Email Problem:**
```
Outlook keeps crashing when I try to send emails with attachments larger than 5MB. I get an error message "Outlook has stopped working" and it closes completely. This happens consistently with PDF files.
```

**Login Issue:**
```
I can't log into my work account. I'm getting "Invalid credentials" error even though I'm sure my password is correct. I tried resetting it but the reset email never arrived.
```

**Hardware Problem:**
```
My laptop fan is making loud noise and the computer is running very slowly. It gets hot to touch and sometimes shuts down unexpectedly. This started about a week ago.
```

### ‚ùå **Bad Examples (Don't use these):**

- "hello" - This is just a greeting, not a problem
- "help" - Too vague, no specific issue
- "something is wrong" - No details about what's wrong
- "I need assistance" - Not a technical problem report

## üéØ **Tips for Better Support**

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact error messages, file names, or steps to reproduce
2. **Include Context**: Mention your operating system, software versions, when it started
3. **One Problem at a Time**: Report each issue separately for better tracking
4. **Use Technical Terms**: If you know them (e.g., "VPN", "Outlook", "Windows 11")

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

```
